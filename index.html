                <p class="artifactDesc">
                    In October, I was accepted into the hackathon TERMINAL
                    Live, which involved programming an algorithm for a tower
                    defense-style game. Along with two other people (though I
                    was the one who thought up the strategy and programmed it
                    in), we created an algorithm called Meteor (so called
                    because it destroyed the strongest sample algorithm,
                    Raptor), got to the semifinals through a bit of luck, and
                    collectively won $2K! Our semifinal video is on the right,
                    where we somehow defeated our losing matchup against ping
                    cannon-type algorithms and got called out for having the
                    strangest strategy known to man. Winning something here was
                    pretty exhilarating and helped me overcome a bit of the
                    imposter syndrome feeling by showing me that even though I
                    didn’t know a whole lot of technical code, I could still do
                    great things.

                    This year (my freshman year!) I was lucky enough to be
                    accepted into and attend  DubHacks, my first “traditional”
                    hackathon, where I teamed up with three other people to
                    create a technology-infused product in just 24 hours.
                    Together, with me as the leader and sole website developer,
                    we created
                    <a href="http://lgtyqz.github.io/DreamPlan">
                        DreamPlan (defunct because the api key expired)
                    </a>
                    , a web application that
                    helped people find UW classes tailored to their interests.
                    Just type in some keywords or answer a questionnaire, and
                    it intelligently searches the UW course catalog using
                    Microsoft Azure technology to find the classes that are
                    right for you—a great improvement over the basic MyUW
                    search tool. Throughout the DubHacks experience, I
                    learned quite a bit about teamwork and hackathons. DubHacks
                    hammered into me that for a team, having a diversity of
                    experience is optimal for creating new, high-impact ideas
                    and having a diversity in expertise is the best for pumping
                    out those ideas. The hackathon experience also showed me
                    that generally, ideas that have more futuristic technology
                    and grander goals (medicine as a whole is highly valued)
                    tend to win.

                <p class="artifactDesc">
                    ARUW was a thoroughly novel experience, even as a previous
                    project manager. There was just so much going on and so
                    many new things to quickly adapt to—more like working in a
                    small company. However, the experience has been pretty
                    eye-opening to me, and I think in terms of technical
                    experience, this is the place where I’ve grown the most.
                    First of all, I found out just how much math goes into
                    robotics and how important differential equations, physics,
                    and the internet are in trying to control where a robot
                    points its turret. I was also introduced to the web
                    development framework Django, which is somehow even harder
                    to set up than Angular and runs on a new kind of paradigm 
                    that’s less component-based but is designed to work with
                    databases in mind. While it’s had some bumps, the leaders
                    have been very helpful and it’s been a fine experience
                    overall.
